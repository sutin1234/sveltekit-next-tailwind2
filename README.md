![Sveltekit with Tailwind](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jvi8p68ke4kkiv715iby.png)

Go to [**Live Demo**](https://sveltekit-tailwind2.netlify.app/)

# Running the project

Clone this repo and cd to the directory, then run npm or yarn

```bash
npx degit dansvel/sveltekit-typescript-postcss-tailwind2 myproject
cd myproject
pnpm install # or npm or yarn
pnpm run dev
```

Open up your favorite browser, go to localhost:3000 and try clicking around.

Or you can play with the code, just check `src/routes/index.svelte` and try to edit the CSS.

# build and generate static webapp

```bash
pnpm run build
```

with the command above, now you can generate static webapp, you can deploy the project in netlify, begin, vercel or else
